    question: 'What Is The Xoloitzquintle?',
    answer:
      "The Xoloitzcuintle (Shō-lō eats-kwēnt-lee), also known as Xolo (Shō-lō), is one of the world's oldest breeds, with archaeological evidence dating back over 3,000–3,500 years in Mesoamerican civilizations (including Colima, Toltec, Zapotec, Maya, and Aztec cultures). Revered as a sacred spiritual guide and loyal companion, it was believed to guard homes from evil spirits in life and accompany souls through the dangers of Mictlan (the Aztec underworld/afterlife) to reach eternal rest. Named after the god Xolotl (lightning, death, and transformation) and the Nahuatl word for dog (itzcuintli), the Xolo symbolizes protection, healing, and the journey between worlds.",
